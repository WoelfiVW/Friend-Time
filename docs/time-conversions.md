# Time Conversions

There are 2 main ways that Friend Time can convert times that are mentioned in chat.

1. Converting to Your Time Zone
2. Converting to the Server's List of Time Zones

## 1. Convert to Your Time Zone

Friend Time can convert times to your time zone simply by clicking the clock emoji that appears when times are mentioned in chat.

Friend Time automatically reacts with a clock emoji:

If you also react with the same emoji, Friend Time will message you with the times converted to your time zone:

## 2. Convert to List of Time Zones

Another way that Friend Time can convert times is by using the server's time zone list. This is a list of up to 10 time zones which Friend Time will always convert to and send after a time is mentioned in chat.

To use this list, the server must have the [List](settings/server-settings/list.md) setting enabled, and also must have at least one time zone in the [server's time zone list](commands/admin-commands/list.md).
